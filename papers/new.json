      "abstractNote": "The purpose of this research is to find a neural-network-based solution to the well-known problem of branch divergence in Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectures. Our approach differs from existing techniques that handle branch (or control-flow) divergence, which use costly hardware modifications, low-utilization masking techniques, or static prediction methods. As we examine divergent applications, we characterize the degree of data-dependent control flow seen in each and isolate the code regions (or \u201ckernels\u201d) that cause the most performance degradation due to branch divergence. We then train neural networks (NNs) offline to approximate these kernels and inject the NN computations directly into the applications as substitutes for the kernels they approximate. This essentially translates control flow into nondivergent computation, trading off precision for performance. As our methodology manipulates application source code directly, it is inherently platform agnostic and can be adopted as a general means for accelerating divergent applications on data-parallel architectures. In this article, we present the Neuralizer, an automated software flow for kernel identification, NN training, and NN integration, as well as supplementary user-controlled optimization techniques. Evaluating our approach on a variety of divergent applications run on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), we on average achieve performance gains of 13.6 \u00d7 and energy savings of 14.8 \u00d7 with 96% accuracy.",

      "abstractNote": "In computer architecture, signi\ufb01cant innovation frequently comes from industry. However, the simulation tools used by industry are often not released for open use, and even when they are, the exact details of industrial designs are not disclosed. As a result, research in the architecture space must ensure that assumptions about contemporary processor design remain true. To help bridge the gap between opaque industrial innovation and public research, we introduce three mechanisms that make it much easier for GPU simulators to keep up with industry. First, we introduce a new GPU simulator frontend that minimizes the effort required to simulate different machine ISAs through trace-driven simulation of NVIDIA\u2019s native machine ISA, while still supporting execution-driven simulation of the virtual ISA. Second, we extensively update GPGPU-Sim\u2019s performance model to increase its level of detail, con\ufb01gurability and accuracy. Finally, surrounding the new frontend and \ufb02exible performance model is an infrastructure that enables quick, detailed validation. A comprehensive set of microbenchmarks and automated correlation plotting ease the modeling process.",

      "abstractNote": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are rapidly dominating the accelerator space, as illustrated by their wide-spread adoption in the data analytics and machine learning markets. At the same time, performance per watt has emerged as a crucial evaluation metric together with peak performance. As such, GPU architects require robust tools that will enable them to model both the performance and the power consumption of modern GPUs. However, while GPU performance modeling has progressed in great strides, power modeling has lagged behind. To mitigate this problem we propose AccelWattch, a configurable GPU power model that resolves two long-standing needs: the lack of a detailed and accurate cycle-level power model for modern GPU architectures, and the inability to capture their constant and static power with existing tools. AccelWattch can be driven by emulation and trace-driven environments, hardware counters, or a mix of the two, models both PTX and SASS ISAs, accounts for power gating and control-flow divergence, and supports DVFS. We integrate AccelWattch with GPGPU-Sim and Accel-Sim to facilitate its widespread use. We validate AccelWattch on a NVIDIA Volta GPU, and show that it achieves strong correlation against hardware power measurements. Finally, we demonstrate that AccelWattch can enable reliable design space exploration: by directly applying AccelWattch tuned for Volta on GPU configurations resembling NVIDIA Pascal and Turing GPUs, we obtain accurate power models for these architectures.",

      "abstractNote": "Modern heterogeneous FPGA architectures incorporate a variety of hardened blocks for boosting the performance of arithmeticintensive designs, such as DSP blocks and carry blocks. Since hardened blocks can be configured in different ways, a variety of datapath patterns can be mapped into these blocks. We observe that existing high-level synthesis (HLS) tools often fail to capture some of the operation mapping patterns, leading to limited estimation accuracy in terms of resource usage and delay. To address this deficiency, we propose to exploit graph neural networks (GNN) to automatically learn operation mapping patterns. We apply GNN models that are trained on microbenchmarks directly to realistic designs through inductive learning. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively infer various valid mapping patterns on both microbenchmarks and realistic designs. Furthermore, the proposed framework is exploited to improve the accuracy of delay estimation in HLS.",

      "abstractNote": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely studied in various graph data mining tasks. Most existing GNNs embed graph data into Euclidean space and thus are less effective to capture the ubiquitous hierarchical structures in real-world networks. Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) extend GNNs to hyperbolic space and thus are more effective to capture the hierarchical structures of graphs in node representation learning. In hyperbolic geometry, the graph hierarchical structure can be re\ufb02ected by the curvatures of the hyperbolic space, and different curvatures can model different hierarchical structures of a graph. However, most existing HGNNs manually set the curvature to a \ufb01xed value for simplicity, which achieves a suboptimal performance of graph learning due to the complex and diverse hierarchical structures of the graphs. To resolve this problem, we propose an Adaptive Curvature Exploration Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network named ACE-HGNN to adaptively learn the optimal curvature according to the input graph and downstream tasks. Speci\ufb01cally, ACE-HGNN exploits a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework and contains two agents, ACE-Agent and HGNN-Agent for learning the curvature and node representations, respectively. The two agents are updated by a Nash Q-leaning algorithm collaboratively, seeking the optimal hyperbolic space indexed by the curvature. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets demonstrate a signi\ufb01cant and consistent performance improvement in model quality with competitive performance and good generalization ability.",

In contrast to the graph structure data, the i.i.d. node embeddings can be processed e ciently in terms of both time and space. Current semi-supervised graph embedding algorithms assume the labelled nodes are given, which may not be always true in the real world. While manually label all training data is inapplicable, how to select the subset of training data to label so as to maximize the graph analysis task performance is of great importance. is motivates our proposed active graph embedding (AGE) framework, in which we design a general active learning query strategy for any semi-supervised graph embedding algorithm. AGE selects the most informative nodes as the training labelled nodes based on the graphical information (i.e., node centrality) as well as the learnt node embedding (i.e., node classi cation uncertainty and node embedding representativeness). Di erent query criteria are combined with the time-sensitive parameters which shi the focus from graph based query criteria to embedding based criteria as the learning progresses. Experiments have been conducted on three public datasets and the results veri ed the effectiveness of each component of our query strategy and the power of combining them using time-sensitive parameters.

      "title": "Analyzing the impact of soft errors in VGG networks implemented on GPUs",
      "abstractNote": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models are widely implemented on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) due to their computational powers, particularly, in object classi\ufb01cation and detection. In safety-critical environments, reliability issues of these models induced by soft errors are a major concern. In this paper, we analyze the reliability of VGG model, a well-known CNN architecture, through two metrics: (1) the so-called Kernels Vulnerability Factor (KVF) used to identify vulnerable kernels and (2) the Layer Vulnerability Factor (LVF) used to determine track fault propagation through layers. As our model runs on an NVIDIA's GPU, our main evaluation tool in this study is the fault injector called SASSIFI. Our results show that Im2col presents the highest vulnerability among all kernels and hardening this kernel signi\ufb01cantly reduces silent data corruption rate by 85.67% with 35.63% time penalty. The average of errors causing misclassi\ufb01cation may reach up to 19.7% in some injection modes and this may be extremely high and unacceptable. Fault injection mode a\ufb00ects both KVF and LVF because RF mode is performed at architecture level, while IOV and IOA modes are at a di\ufb00erent level (i.e., program level). Also, a thorough comparison among VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet indicates that LVF and KVF are determined by CNN network architecture. This is because layers of these networks, particularly convolutional layers, are implemented with the Im2col kernel, the most vulnerable and invoked in these CNN networks.",

      "abstractNote": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signi\ufb01cantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.",

      "abstractNote": "Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving signi\ufb01cantly over existing approaches. These architectures alternate between a propagation layer that aggregates the hidden states of the local neighborhood and a fully-connected layer. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that a linear model, that removes all the intermediate fullyconnected layers, is still able to achieve a performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. This signi\ufb01cantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for semi-supervised learning where number of labeled examples are small. This in turn allows a room for designing more innovative propagation layers. Based on this insight, we propose a novel graph neural network that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, and replaces the propagation layers with attention mechanisms that respect the structure of the graph. The attention mechanism allows us to learn a dynamic and adaptive local summary of the neighborhood to achieve more accurate predictions. In a number of experiments on benchmark citation networks datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods. By examining the attention weights among neighbors, we show that our model provides some interesting insights on how neighbors in\ufb02uence each other.",

      "title": "BinFI: An Efficient Fault Injector for Safety-Critical Machine Learning Systems",
      "abstractNote": "As machine learning (ML) becomes pervasive in high performance computing, ML has found its way into safety-critical domains (e.g., autonomous vehicles). Thus the reliability of ML has grown in importance. Specifically, failures of ML systems can have catastrophic consequences, and can occur due to soft errors, which are increasing in frequency due to system scaling. Therefore, we need to evaluate ML systems in the presence of soft errors.In this work, we propose BinFI, an efficient fault injector (FI) for finding the safety-critical bits in ML applications. We find the widely-used ML computations are often monotonic. Thus we can approximate the error propagation behavior of a ML application as a monotonic function. BinFI uses a binary-search like FI technique to pinpoint the safety-critical bits (also measure the overall resilience). BinFI identifies 99.56% of safety-critical bits (with 99.63% precision) in the systems, which significantly outperforms random FI, with much lower costs.",

      "abstractNote": "Power consumption in the dense chip multiprocessors restricts the operational life of the battery operated devices. Voltage scaling for ensuring longer battery life exhibits hard and soft errors in cache. Hard faults, early detectable at boot time, are tractable but soft errors, being unpredictable in nature, are indeed hard to handle. Error correcting codes for soft error mitigation perform effectively for single event upsets (SEUs) but future technology nodes are anticipated to have signi\ufb01cant multi bit upsets (MBUs) due to miniaturization which demands additional system level protection. Several redundancy based schemes have been proposed but none of them reported any scalable solution for shared NUCA cache in multicore and suffered from either low coverage due to partial redundancy or performance degradation due to capacity loss in full coverage. This work addresses both these issues by ensuring full error coverage with minimum cache bypass. Errors are detected using simple error detection technique like CRC and the dirty as well as reusable clean words are replicated either locally in same tile or globally to remote tiles to ensure complete error coverage. Word re-usability is calculated using a Markov Chain based novel re-usability prediction mechanism by analysing the cache access pattern. An invalidation strategy is applied that invalidates nonreusable words for reducing the vulnerable time to soft errors. A re-usability aware replacement policy is also designed that replaces the line with lowest re-usability, calculated at line level. The proposed technique has been evaluated in Multi2Sim 5.0 simulation framework with the benchmark programs in SPEC CPU2000 suite. The results indicate on average 83.33% decrease of vulnerability for integer benchmarks and 87.09% for \ufb02oating point benchmarks, with full multi-bit error coverage, at the cost of 4.99% area, 5.54% dynamic power and 6.55% leakage power overheads with negligible performance penalty.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents Penny, a compiler-directed resilience scheme for protecting GPU register files (RF) against soft errors. Penny replaces the conventional error correction code (ECC) based RF protection by using less expensive error detection code (EDC) along with idempotence based recovery. Compared to the ECC protection, Penny can achieve either the same level of RF resilience yet with significantly lower hardware costs or stronger resilience using the same ECC due to its ability to detect multi-bit errors when it is used solely for detection. In particular, to address the lack of store buffers in GPUs, which causes both checkpoint storage overwriting and the high cost of checkpointing stores, Penny provides several compiler optimizations such as storage coloring and checkpoint pruning. Across 25 benchmark applications, Penny causes only \u22483% run-time overhead on average.",

      "abstractNote": "Rapidly shrinking technology node and voltage scaling increase the susceptibility of Soft Errors in digital circuits. Soft Errors are radiation-induced effects while the radiation particles such as Alpha, Neutrons or Heavy Ions, interact with sensitive regions of microelectronic devices/circuits. The particle hit could be a glancing blow or a penetrating strike. A well apprehended and characterized way of analyzing soft error effects is the fault-injection campaign, but that typically acknowledged as time and resource-consuming simulation strategy. As an alternative to traditional fault injection-based methodologies and to explore the applicability of modern graph based neural network algorithms in the \ufb01eld of reliability modeling, this paper proposes a systematic framework that explores gate-level abstractions to extract and exploit relevant feature representations at low-dimensional vector space. The framework allows the extensive prediction analysis of SEU type soft error effects in a given circuit. A scalable and inductive type representation learning algorithm on graphs called GraphSAGE has been utilized for ef\ufb01ciently extracting structural features of the gate-level netlist, providing a valuable database to exercise a downstream machine learning or deep learning algorithm aiming at predicting fault propagation metrics. Functional Failure Rate (FFR): the predicted fault propagating metric of SEU type fault within the gate-level circuit abstraction of the 10-Gigabit Ethernet MAC (IEEE 802.3) standard circuit.",

      "title": "Daisen: A Framework for Visualizing Detailed GPU Execution",
      "abstractNote": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been widely used to accelerate arti\ufb01cial intelligence, physics simulation, medical imaging, and information visualization applications. To improve GPU performance, GPU hardware designers need to identify performance issues by inspecting a huge amount of simulator-generated traces. Visualizing the execution traces can reduce the cognitive burden of users and facilitate making sense of behaviors of GPU hardware components. In this paper, we \ufb01rst formalize the process of GPU performance analysis and characterize the design requirements of visualizing execution traces based on a survey study and interviews with GPU hardware designers. We contribute data and task abstraction for GPU performance analysis. Based on our task analysis, we propose Daisen, a framework that supports data collection from GPU simulators and provides visualization of the simulator-generated GPU execution traces. Daisen features a data abstraction and trace format that can record simulator-generated GPU execution traces. Daisen also includes a web-based visualization tool that helps GPU hardware designers examine GPU execution traces, identify performance bottlenecks, and verify performance improvement. Our qualitative evaluation with GPU hardware designers demonstrates that the design of Daisen re\ufb02ects the typical work\ufb02ow of GPU hardware designers. Using Daisen, participants were able to effectively identify potential performance bottlenecks and opportunities for performance improvement. The open-sourced implementation of Daisen can be found at gitlab.com/akita/vis. Supplemental materials including a demo video, survey questions, evaluation study guide, and post-study evaluation survey are available at osf.io/j5ghq.",

      "abstractNote": "State-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have limited scalability with respect to the graph and model sizes. On large graphs, increasing the model depth often means exponential expansion of the scope (i.e., receptive \ufb01eld). Beyond just a few layers, two fundamental challenges emerge: 1. degraded expressivity due to oversmoothing, and 2. expensive computation due to neighborhood explosion. We propose a design principle to decouple the depth and scope of GNNs \u2013 to generate representation of a target entity (i.e., a node or an edge), we \ufb01rst extract a localized subgraph as the bounded-size scope, and then apply a GNN of arbitrary depth on top of the subgraph. A properly extracted subgraph consists of a small number of critical neighbors, while excluding irrelevant ones. The GNN, no matter how deep it is, smooths the local neighborhood into informative representation rather than oversmoothing the global graph into \u201cwhite noise\u201d. Theoretically, decoupling improves the GNN expressive power from the perspectives of graph signal processing (GCN), function approximation (GraphSAGE) and topological learning (GIN). Empirically, on seven graphs (with up to 110M nodes) and six backbone GNN architectures, our design achieves signi\ufb01cant accuracy improvement with orders of magnitude reduction in computation and hardware cost.",

      "abstractNote": "Soft errors are increasing in computer systems due to shrinking feature sizes. Soft errors can induce incorrect outputs, also called silent data corruption (SDC), which raises no warnings in the system and hence is difficult to detect. To prevent SDC effectively, protection techniques require a fine-grained profiling of SDC-prone instructions, which is often obtained by applying machine learning models. However, these models rely on handcrafted features, and lack the ability to reason about SDC propagation, which leads to an inferior SDC prediction performance. We propose a novel Graph Attention neTwork to Predict SDC-prone instructions (GATPS). The GATPS representation is a heterogeneous graph with different types of edges to represent various instruction relations. By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods\u2019 features, GATPS automatically captures the structural features that contribute to SDC propagation. The attention mechanism is applied to compute the importance values to the neighboring nodes, which quantifies the fault effect on the neighboring nodes. Moreover, the inductive model of GATPS can be applied to unseen programs without retraining, and it requires no fault injection information of the target program. Experiments revealed GATPS achieved a 34% higher F1 score compared to the baseline method and a 40-fold speedup compared to the fault injection approach.",

      "abstractNote": "Graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely used in general-purpose high-performance computing applications (i.e., GPGPUs), which require reliable execution in the presence of soft errors. To support massive thread-level parallelism, a sizeable register \ufb01le is adopted in GPUs, which is highly vulnerable to soft errors. Although modern commercial GPUs provide single-errorcorrection double-error-detection (SEC-DED) error correction code (ECC) for the register \ufb01le, it consumes a considerable amount of energy due to frequent register accesses and leakage power of ECC storage. In this article, we propose to leverage the error sensitivity of instructions, the duplicate characteristics of the same-named registers, and the error sensitivity of data bits to build a uni\ufb01ed energy-ef\ufb01cient ECC mechanism for a GPGPUs register \ufb01le (Eff-ECC), which consists of instructionaware ECC (IA-ECC), duplication-aware ECC (DA-ECC), and bit-aware ECC (BA-ECC). Considering the error sensitivity of instructions, IA-ECC merely implements ECCs for the write registers of critical instructions. Observing the same-named registers across threads usually keeps the same data, DA-ECC avoids unnecessary ECC generation and veri\ufb01cation for duplicate register values. Leveraging the inherent error-tolerance features of the program, BA-ECC merely protects signi\ufb01cant bits of registers to combat the crucial error. Experimental results demonstrate that Eff-ECC tremendously reduces 86.46% energy consumption of traditional SEC-DED ECC.",

      "abstractNote": "Lithography hotspot detection is of great importance in chip manufacturing. It aims to \ufb01nd patterns that may incur defects in the early design stage. Inspired by the success of deep learning in computer vision, many works convert layouts into images, turn the hotspot detection problem into an image classi\ufb01cation task. Traditional graph-based methods consume fewer computer resources and less detection time compared to imagebased methods, but they have too many false alarms. In this paper, a hotspot detection approach via the graph neural network (GNN) is proposed. We also propose a novel representation model to map a layout to one graph, in which we introduce multi-dimensional features to encode components of the layout. Then we use a modi\ufb01ed GNN to further process the extracted layout features and get an embedding of the local geometric relationship. Experimental results on the ICCAD2012 Contest benchmarks show our proposed approach can achieve over 10\u00d7 speedup and fewer false alarms without loss of accuracy. On the ICCAD2020 benchmark, our model can achieve 2.10% higher accuracy compared with the previous approach.",

AVF captures both microarchitectural and architectural fault masking effects; therefore, AVF measurements cannot generate insight into the vulnerability of software independent of hardware. To evaluate the behavior of software in the presence of hardware faults, we must isolate the software-dependent (architecture-level masking) portion of AVF from the hardware-dependent (microarchitecture-level masking) portion, providing a quantitative basis to make reliability decisions about software independent of hardware.",

      "abstractNote": "Modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require a massive amount of convolution operations. To address the overwhelming computation problem, Winograd and FFT fast algorithms have been used as effective approaches to reduce the number of multiplications. Inputs and \ufb01lters are transformed into special domains then perform element-wise multiplication, which can be transformed into batched GEMM operation. Different stages of computation contain multiple tasks with different computation and memory behaviors, and they share intermediate data, which provides the opportunity to fuse these tasks into a monolithic kernel. But traditional kernel fusion suffers from the problem of insuf\ufb01cient shared memory, which limits the performance. In this article, we propose a new kernel fusion technique for fast convolution algorithms based on MegaKernel. GPU thread blocks are assigned with different computation tasks and we design a mapping algorithm to assign tasks to thread blocks. We build a scheduler which fetches and executes the tasks following the dependency relationship. Evaluation of modern CNNs shows that our techniques achieve an average of 1.25X and 1.7X speedup compared to cuDNN\u2019s two implementations on Winograd convolution algorithm.",

      "title": "ePVF: An Enhanced Program Vulnerability Factor Methodology for Cross-Layer Resilience Analysis",
      "abstractNote": "The Program Vulnerability Factor (PVF) has been proposed as a metric to understand the impact of hardware faults on software. The PVF is calculated by identifying the program bits required for architecturally correct execution (ACE bits). PVF, however, is conservative as it assumes that all erroneous executions are a major concern, not just those that result in silent data corruptions, and it also does not account for errors that are detected at runtime, i.e., lead to program crashes. A more discriminating metric can inform the choice of the appropriate resilience techniques with acceptable performance and energy overheads. This paper proposes ePVF, an enhancement of the original PVF methodology, which \ufb01lters out the crash-causing bits from the ACE bits identi\ufb01ed by the traditional PVF analysis. The ePVF methodology consists of an error propagation model that reasons about error propagation in the program, and a crash model that encapsulates the platform-speci\ufb01c characteristics for handling hardware exceptions. ePVF reduces the vulnerable bits estimated by the original PVF analysis by between 45% and 67% depending on the benchmark, and has high accuracy (89% recall, 92% precision) in identifying the crash-causing bits. We demonstrate the utility of ePVF by using it to inform selective protection of the most SDC-prone instructions in a program.",

      "abstractNote": "The reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) against hardware errors is essential as DNNs are increasingly employed in safety-critical applications such as automatic driving. Transient errors in memory, such as radiation-induced soft error, may propagate through the inference computation, resulting in unexpected output, which can adversely trigger catastrophic system failures. As a \ufb01rst step to tackle this problem, this paper proposes constructing a vulnerability model (VM) with a small number of fault injections to identify vulnerable model parameters in DNN. We reduce the number of bit locations for fault injection signi\ufb01cantly and develop a \ufb02ow to incrementally collect the training data, i.e., the fault injection results, for VM accuracy improvement. Experimental results show that VM can estimate vulnerabilities of all DNN model parameters only with 1/3490 computations compared with traditional fault injectionbased vulnerability estimation.",

      "title": "FASTGCN: FAST LEARNING WITH GRAPH CONVOLU- TIONAL NETWORKS VIA IMPORTANCE SAMPLING",
      "abstractNote": "The graph convolutional networks (GCN) recently proposed by Kipf and Welling are an effective graph model for semi-supervised learning. This model, however, was originally designed to be learned with the presence of both training and test data. Moreover, the recursive neighborhood expansion across layers poses time and memory challenges for training with large, dense graphs. To relax the requirement of simultaneous availability of test data, we interpret graph convolutions as integral transforms of embedding functions under probability measures. Such an interpretation allows for the use of Monte Carlo approaches to consistently estimate the integrals, which in turn leads to a batched training scheme as we propose in this work\u2014FastGCN. Enhanced with importance sampling, FastGCN not only is ef\ufb01cient for training but also generalizes well for inference. We show a comprehensive set of experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness compared with GCN and related models. In particular, training is orders of magnitude more ef\ufb01cient while predictions remain comparably accurate.",

      "abstractNote": "Cloud providers now offer transient servers, which they may revoke at anytime, for signi\ufb01cantly lower prices than ondemand servers, which they cannot revoke. The low price of transient servers is particularly attractive for executing an emerging class of workload, which we call Batch-Interactive Data-Intensive (BIDI), that is becoming increasingly important for data analytics. BIDI workloads require large sets of servers to cache massive datasets in memory to enable low latency operation. In this paper, we illustrate the challenges of executing BIDI workloads on transient servers, where revocations (akin to failures) are the common case. To address these challenges, we design Flint, which is based on Spark and includes automated checkpointing and server selection policies that i) support batch and interactive applications and ii) dynamically adapt to application characteristics. We evaluate a prototype of Flint using EC2 spot instances, and show that it yields cost savings of up to 90% compared to using on-demand servers, while increasing running time by < 2%.",

      "abstractNote": "As high-performance computing systems scale in size and computational power, the danger of silent errors, i.e., errors that can bypass hardware detection mechanisms and impact application state, grows dramatically. Consequently, applications running on HPC systems need to exhibit resilience to such errors. Previous work has found that, for certain codes, this resilience can come for free, i.e., some applications are naturally resilient, but few studies have shown the code patterns\u2014combinations or sequences of computations\u2014that make an application naturally resilient. In this paper, we present FlipTracker, a framework designed to extract these patterns using \ufb01ne-grained tracking of error propagation and resilience properties, and we use it to present a set of computation patterns that are responsible for making representative HPC applications naturally resilient to errors. This not only enables a deeper understanding of resilience properties of these codes, but also can guide future application designs towards patterns with natural resilience.",

      "abstractNote": "Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) is a core library in scientific computing and machine learning. This paper presents FT-BLAS, a new implementation of BLAS routines that not only tolerates soft errors on the fly, but also provides comparable performance to modern state-of-the-art BLAS libraries on widely-used processors such as Intel Skylake and Cascade Lake. To accommodate the features of BLAS, which contains both memory-bound and computing-bound routines, we propose a hybrid strategy to incorporate fault tolerance into our brand-new BLAS implementation: duplicating computing instructions for memory-bound Level-1 and Level-2 BLAS routines and incorporating an Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance mechanism for computing-bound Level-3 BLAS routines. Our high performance and low overhead are obtained from delicate assembly-level optimization and a kernel-fusion approach to the computing kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that FT-BLAS offers high reliability and high performance \u2013 faster than Intel MKL, OpenBLAS, and BLIS by up to 3.50%, 22.14% and 21.70%, respectively, for routines spanning all three levels of BLAS we benchmarked, even under hundreds of errors injected per minute.",

      "abstractNote": "Graph convolutional neural networks (GNN) have achieved state-ofthe-art performance on tasks like node classification. It has become a new workload family member in data-centers. GNN works on irregular graph-structured data with three distinct phases: Combination, Graph Processing, and Aggregation. While Combination phase has been well supported by sgemm kernels in cuBLAS, the other two phases are still inefficient on GPGPU due to the lack of optimized CUDA kernels. In particular, Aggregation phase introduces large volume of DRAM storage footprint and data movement, and both Aggregation and Graph Processing phases suffer from high kernel launching time. These inefficiencies not only decrease training throughput but also limit users from training GNNs on larger graphs on GPGPU. Although these problems have been partially alleviated by recent studies, their optimizations are still not sufficient. In this paper, we propose fuseGNN, an extension of PyTorch that provides highly optimized APIs and CUDA kernels for GNN. First, two different programming abstractions for Aggregation phase are utilized to handle graphs with different average degrees. Second, dedicated GPGPU kernels are developed for Aggregation and Graph Processing in both forward and backward passes, in which kernel-fusion along with other optimization strategies are applied to reduce kernel launching time and latency as well as exploit data reuse opportunities. Evaluation on multiple benchmarks shows that fuseGNN achieves up to 5.3\u00d7 end-to-end speedup over stateof-the-art frameworks, and the DRAM storage footprint is reduced by several orders of magnitude on large datasets.",

      "abstractNote": "Due to the continuous technology scaling and lowering of operating voltages, modern computer systems are highly vulnerable to soft errors induced by the high-energy particles. Soft errors can corrupt program outputs leading to silent data corruption or a Crash. To protect computer systems against such failures, architects need to precisely and quickly identify vulnerable program instructions that need to be protected. Traditional techniques for program reliability estimation either use expensive and time-consuming fault injection or inaccurate analytical models to identify the program instructions that need to be protected against soft errors. In this work, we present GLAIVE, a graph learning-assisted model for fast, accurate, and transferable soft-error induced instruction vulnerability estimation. GLAIVE leverages a synergy between static analysis and datadriven statistical reasoning to automatically learn signatures of instruction-level vulnerabilities and their propagation to program outputs using a \ufb01ne-grain error propagation information from the bit-level program graphs of a set of realistic benchmarks. Our experiments show that the learned knowledge of instruction vulnerability is transferable to unseen programs. We further show that GLAIVE can achieve an average 221\u00d7 speedup and up to 33.09% lower program vulnerability estimation error as compared to a baseline fault-injection technique, up to 30.29% higher vulnerability estimation accuracy, and on average can cover up to 90.23% vulnerable instructions for a given protection budget compared to a set of baseline machine learning algorithms.",

      "abstractNote": "Question Answering (QA) has been a long-standing research topic in AI and NLP \ufb01elds, and a wealth of studies have been conducted to attempt to equip QA systems with human-level reasoning capability. To approximate the complicated human reasoning process, state-of-the-art QA systems commonly use pre-trained language models (LMs) to access knowledge encoded in LMs together with elaborately designed modules based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to perform reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs). However, many problems remain open regarding the reasoning functionality of these GNN-based modules. Can these GNN-based modules really perform a complex reasoning process? Are they under- or overcomplicated for QA? To open the black box of GNN and investigate these problems, we dissect state-of-the-art GNN modules for QA and analyze their reasoning capability. We discover that even a very simple graph neural counter can outperform all the existing GNN modules on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA, two popular QA benchmark datasets which heavily rely on knowledge-aware reasoning. Our work reveals that existing knowledge-aware GNN modules may only carry out some simple reasoning such as counting. It remains a challenging open problem to build comprehensive reasoning modules for knowledge-powered QA.",

However, these techniques are highly resource- and time-intensive. Prior research developed a model, TRIDENT to analytically predict Silent Data Corruption (SDC, i.e., incorrect output without any indication) probabilities of single-threaded CPU applications without requiring FIs. Unfortunately, TRIDENT is incompatible with GPU programs, due to their high degree of parallelism and different memory architectures than CPU programs. The main challenge is that modeling error propagation across thousands of threads in a GPU kernel requires enormous amounts of data to be pro\ufb01led and analyzed, posing a major scalability bottleneck for HPC applications.",

      "abstractNote": "General-purpose GPUs (GPGPUs) are becoming prevalent in mainstream computing, and performance per watt has emerged as a more crucial evaluation metric than peak performance. As such, GPU architects require robust tools that will enable them to quickly explore new ways to optimize GPGPUs for energy e\ufb03ciency. We propose a new GPGPU power model that is con\ufb01gurable, capable of cycle-level calculations, and carefully validated against real hardware measurements. To achieve con\ufb01gurability, we use a bottom-up methodology and abstract parameters from the microarchitectural components as the model\u2019s inputs. We developed a rigorous suite of 80 microbenchmarks that we use to bound any modeling uncertainties and inaccuracies. The power model is comprehensively validated against measurements of two commercially available GPUs, and the measured error is within 9.9% and 13.4% for the two target GPUs (GTX 480 and Quadro FX5600). The model also accurately tracks the power consumption trend over time. We integrated the power model with the cycle-level simulator GPGPU-Sim and demonstrate the energy savings by utilizing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and clock gating. Traditional DVFS reduces GPU energy consumption by 14.4% by leveraging within-kernel runtime variations. More \ufb01ner-grained SM cluster-level DVFS improves the energy savings from 6.6% to 13.6% for those benchmarks that show clustered execution behavior. We also show that clock gating inactive lanes during divergence reduces dynamic power by 11.2%.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper introduces GRANNITE, a GPUaccelerated novel graph neural network (GNN) model for fast, accurate, and transferable vector-based average power estimation. During training, GRANNITE learns how to propagate average toggle rates through combinational logic: a netlist is represented as a graph, register states and unit inputs from RTL simulation are used as features, and combinational gate toggle rates are used as labels. A trained GNN model can then infer average toggle rates on a new workload of interest or new netlists from RTL simulation results in a few seconds. Compared to traditional power analysis using gate-level simulations, GRANNITE achieves >18.7X speedup with an error of only <5.5% across a diverse set of benchmark circuits. Compared to a GPU-accelerated conventional probabilistic switching activity estimation approach, GRANNITE achieves much better accuracy (on average 25.9% lower error) at similar runtimes.",

Modeling physics systems, learning molecular \ufb01ngerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.",

      "abstractNote": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results on a broad spectrum of applications. Most empirical studies of GNNs directly take the observed graph as input, assuming the observed structure perfectly depicts the accurate and complete relations between nodes. However, graphs in the real-world are inevitably noisy or incomplete, which could even exacerbate the quality of graph representations. In this work, we propose a novel Variational Information Bottleneck guided Graph Structure Learning framework, namely VIB-GSL, in the perspective of information theory. VIB-GSL is the first attempt to advance the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle for graph structure learning, providing a more elegant and universal framework for mining underlying task-relevant relations. VIB-GSL learns an informative and compressive graph structure to distill the actionable information for specific downstream tasks. VIB-GSL deduces a variational approximation for irregular graph data to form a tractable IB objective function, which facilitates training stability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the superior effectiveness and robustness of VIB-GSL.",

Soft errors may cause Silent Data Corruptions (SDCs), which produces erroneous execution results silently. Due to the massive parallelism of GPGPUs, fully protecting them against soft errors introduces nontrivial overhead. Fortunately, imprecise execution outcomes are inherently tolerable for some HPC programs due to the nature of these applications. Leveraging the feature, selective soft error protection can be applied to reduce energy consumptions.",

A novel framework, GTuner, is proposed to jointly learn from the structures of computational graphs and the statistical features of codes to find the optimal code implementations. A Graph ATtention network (GAT) is designed as the performance estimator in GTuner. In GAT, graph neural layers are used to propagate the information in the graph and a multi-head self-attention module is designed to learn the complicated relationships between the features. Under the guidance of GAT, the GPU codes are generated through auto-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous arts remarkably.",

      "abstractNote": "With the ever-shrinking size of transistors and increasing scale of applications, silent data corruptions (SDCs) have become a common yet serious issue in HPC applications. Selective instruction duplication (SID) is a popular faulttolerance technique that can obtain a high SDC coverage with low-performance overhead, as it selects the most vulnerable parts of a program for protection with priority. However, existing studies of SID are confined to single program input in the evaluation, assuming that the error resilience of the program remains similar across inputs, leading to a drastic loss of SDC coverage from SID when the protected program runs different inputs. Hence, we proposed Sentinel, an automated compiler-based framework to mitigate the loss of SDC coverage. Evaluation results show that Sentinel can effectively mitigate the loss of SDC coverage (up to 97.00%) across multiple inputs, which significantly hardens existing SID techniques.",

      "abstractNote": "Fault injection (FI) is a commonly used experimental technique to evaluate the resilience of software techniques for tolerating hardware faults. Software-implemented FI can be performed at different levels of abstraction in the system stack; FI performed at the compiler\u2019s intermediate representation (IR) level has the advantage that it is closer to the program being evaluated and is hence easier to derive insights from for the design of software fault-tolerance mechanisms. Unfortunately, it is not clear how accurate IR-level FI is vis-a-vis FI performed at the assembly code level, and prior work has presented contradictory \ufb01ndings. In this article, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of IR-level FI across a range of benchmark programs and compiler optimization levels. Our results show that IR-level FI is as accurate as assembly-level FI for silent data corruption (SDC) probability estimation across different benchmarks and optimization levels. Further, we present a machine-learning-based technique for improving the accuracy of crash probability measurements made by IR-level FI, which takes advantage of an observed correlation between program crash probabilities and instructions that operate on memory address values. We \ufb01nd that the machine learning technique provides comparable accuracy for IR-level FI as assembly code level FI for program crashes.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents IPAS, an instruction duplication technique that protects scienti\ufb01c applications from silent data corruption (SDC) in their output. The motivation for IPAS is that, due to natural error masking, only a subset of SDC errors actually affects the output of scienti\ufb01c codes\u2014we call these errors silent output corruption (SOC) errors. Thus applications require duplication only on code that, when affected by a fault, yields SOC. We use machine learning to learn code instructions that must be protected to avoid SOC, and, using a compiler, we protect only those vulnerable instructions by duplication, thus signi\ufb01cantly reducing the overhead that is introduced by instruction duplication. In our experiments with \ufb01ve workloads, IPAS reduces the percentage of SOC by up to 90% with a slowdown that ranges between 1.04\u00d7 and 1.35\u00d7, which corresponds to as much as 47% less slowdown than state-of-the-art instruction duplication techniques.",

To support massive thread level parallelism, a sizeable register \ufb01le is adopted in GPUs, which is highly vulnerable to soft errors. Although modern commercial GPUs provide singleerror-correction double-error-detection (SEC-DED) ECC for the register \ufb01le, it consumes a considerable amount of energy due to frequent register accesses and leakage power of ECC storage.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent explainability related studies have shown that state-of-the-art DNNs do not always adopt correct evidences to make decisions. It not only hampers their generalization but also makes them less likely to be trusted by end-users. In pursuit of developing more credible DNNs, in this paper we propose CREX, which encourages DNN models to focus more on evidences that actually matter for the task at hand, and to avoid over\ufb01tting to data-dependent bias and artifacts. Speci\ufb01cally, CREX regularizes the training process of DNNs with rationales, i.e., a subset of features highlighted by domain experts as justi\ufb01cations for predictions, to enforce DNNs to generate local explanations that conform with expert rationales. Even when rationales are not available, CREX still could be useful by requiring the generated explanations to be sparse. Experimental results on two text classi\ufb01cation datasets demonstrate the increased credibility of DNNs trained with CREX. Comprehensive analysis further shows that while CREX does not always improve prediction accuracy on the hold-out test set, it signi\ufb01cantly increases DNN accuracy on new and previously unseen data beyond test set, highlighting the advantage of the increased credibility.",

      "abstractNote": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the defacto standard for representation learning on graphs, which derive effective node representations by recursively aggregating information from graph neighborhoods. \nWhile GNNs can be trained from scratch, pre-training GNNs to learn transferable knowledge for downstream tasks has recently been demonstrated to improve the state of the art. \nHowever, conventional GNN pre-training methods follow a two-step paradigm: 1) pre-training on abundant unlabeled data and 2) fine-tuning on downstream labeled data, between which there exists a significant gap due to the divergence of optimization objectives in the two steps. \nIn this paper, we conduct an analysis to show the divergence between pre-training and fine-tuning, and to alleviate such divergence, we propose L2P-GNN, a self-supervised pre-training strategy for GNNs. \nThe key insight is that L2P-GNN attempts to learn how to fine-tune during the pre-training process in the form of transferable prior knowledge. To encode both local and global information into the prior, L2P-GNN is further designed with a dual adaptation mechanism at both node and graph levels. \nFinally, we conduct a systematic empirical study on the pre-training of various GNN models, using both a public collection of protein graphs and a new compilation of bibliographic graphs for pre-training. Experimental results show that L2P-GNN is capable of learning effective and transferable prior knowledge that yields powerful representations for downstream tasks. \n(Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/rootlu/L2P-GNN.)",

      "abstractNote": "GPUs are widely deployed on large-scale HPC systems to provide powerful computational capability for scienti\ufb01c applications from various domains. As those applications are normally long-running, investigating the characteristics of GPU errors becomes imperative for reliability. In this paper, we \ufb01rst study the system conditions that trigger GPU errors using sixmonth trace data collected from a large-scale, operational HPC system. Then, we use machine learning to predict the occurrence of GPU errors, by taking advantage of temporal and spatial dependencies of the trace data. The resulting machine learning prediction framework is robust and accurate under different workloads.",

      "title": "Minotaur: Adapting Software Testing Techniques for Hardware Errors",
      "abstractNote": "With the end of conventional CMOS scaling, efficient resiliency solutions are needed to address the increased likelihood of hardware errors. Silent data corruptions (SDCs) are especially harmful because they can create unacceptable output without the user's knowledge. Several resiliency analysis techniques have been proposed to identify SDC-causing instructions, but they remain too slow for practical use and/or sacrifice accuracy to improve analysis speed. We develop Minotaur, a novel toolkit to improve the speed and accuracy of resiliency analysis. The key insight behind Minotaur is that modern resiliency analysis has many conceptual similarities to software testing; therefore, adapting techniques from the rich software testing literature can lead to principled and significant improvements in resiliency analysis. Minotaur identifies and adapts four concepts from software testing: 1) it introduces the concept of input quality criteria for resiliency analysis and identifies PC coverage as a simple but effective criterion; 2) it creates (fast) minimized inputs from (slow) standard benchmark inputs, using the input quality criteria to assess the goodness of the created input; 3) it adapts the concept of test case prioritization to prioritize error injections and invoke early termination for a given instruction to speed up error-injection campaigns; and 4) it further adapts test case or input prioritization to accelerate SDC discovery across multiple inputs. We evaluate Minotaur by applying it to Approxilyzer, a state-of-the-art resiliency analysis tool. Minotaur's first three techniques speed up Approxilyzer's resiliency analysis by 10.3X (on average) for the workloads studied. Moreover, they identify 96% (on average) of all SDC-causing instructions explored, compared to 64% identified by Approxilyzer alone. Minotaur's fourth technique (input prioritization) enables identifying all SDC-causing instructions explored across multiple inputs at a speed 2.3X faster (on average) than analyzing each input independently for our workloads.",

      "abstractNote": "With the ever-shrinking size of transistors, silent data corruptions (SDCs) are becoming a common yet serious issue in HPC. Selective instruction duplication (SID) is a widely used fault-tolerance technique that can obtain high SDC coverage with low performance overhead. However, existing SID methods are confined to single program input in its assessment, assuming that error resilience of a program remains similar across inputs. Nevertheless, we observe that the assumption cannot always hold, leading to a drastic loss in SDC coverage across different inputs, compromising HPC reliability. We notice that the SDC coverage loss correlates with a small set of instructions - we call them incubative instructions, which reveal elusive error propagation characteristics across multiple inputs. We propose MINPSID, an automated SID framework that automatically identifies and re-prioritizes incubative instructions in a given program to enhance SDC coverage. Evaluation shows MINPSID can effectively mitigate the loss of SDC coverage across multiple inputs.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding application resilience (or error tolerance) in the presence of hardware transient faults on data objects is critical to ensure computing integrity and enable ef\ufb01cient application-level fault tolerance mechanisms. However, we lack a method and a tool to quantify application resilience to transient faults on data objects. The traditional method, random fault injection, cannot help, because of losing data semantics and insuf\ufb01cient information on how and where errors are tolerated. In this paper, we introduce a method and a tool (called \u201cMOARD\u201d) to model and quantify application resilience to transient faults on data objects. Our method is based on systematically quantifying error masking events caused by application-inherent semantics and program constructs. We use MOARD to study how and why errors in data objects can be tolerated by the application. We demonstrate tangible bene\ufb01ts of using MOARD to direct a fault tolerance mechanism to protect data objects.",

      "abstractNote": "Traditional reliability approaches introduce relevant costs to achieve unconditional correctness during data processing. However, many application environments are inherently tolerant to a certain degree of inexactness or inaccuracy. In this article, we focus on the practical scenario of image processing in space, a domain where faults are a threat, while the applications are inherently tolerant to a certain degree of errors. We \ufb01rst introduce the concept of usability of the processed image to relax the traditional requirement of unconditional correctness, and to limit the computational overheads related to reliability. We then introduce our new \ufb02exible and lightweight fault management methodology for inaccurate application environments. A key novelty of our scheme is the utilization of neural networks to reduce the costs associated with the occurrence and the detection of faults. Experiments on two aerospace image processing case studies show overall time savings of 14.89 and 34.72 percent for the two applications, respectively, as compared with the baseline classical Duplication with Comparison scheme.",

introduce the concept of asymptotic application resilience: we show that resilience patterns within the coordinated thread arrays (CTAs), the building blocks of GPGPU parallelism, can project application resilience for larger inputs of arbitrary size. For asymptotically larger inputs of the same type, the number of CTAs naturally increases but follows distinct patterns as dictated by the parallelization logic.

      "title": "NVBit: A Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Framework for NVIDIA GPUs",
      "abstractNote": "Binary instrumentation frameworks are widely used to implement profilers, performance evaluation, error checking, and bug detection tools. While dynamic binary instrumentation tools such as PIN and DynamoRio are supported on CPUs, GPU architectures currently only have limited support for similar capabilities through static compile-time tools, which prohibits instrumentation of dynamically loaded libraries that are foundations for modern highperformance applications. This work presents NVBit, a fast, dynamic, and portable, binary instrumentation framework, that allows users to write instrumentation tools in CUDA/C/C++ and selectively apply that functionality to pre-compiled binaries and libraries executing on NVIDIA GPUs. Using dynamic recompilation at the SASS level, NVBit analyzes GPU kernel register requirements to generate efficient ABI compliant instrumented code without requiring the tool developer to have detailed knowledge of the underlying GPU architecture. NVBit allows basic-block instrumentation, multiple function injections to the same location, inspection of all ISA visible state, dynamic selection of instrumented or uninstrumented code, permanent modification of register state, source code correlation, and instruction removal. NVBit supports all recent NVIDIA GPU architecture families including Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal and Volta and works on any pre-compiled CUDA, OpenACC, OpenCL, or CUDA-Fortran application.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent studies have shown that technology and voltage scaling are expected to increase the likelihood that particle-induced soft errors manifest as multiple-bit errors. This raises concerns about the validity of using single bit-\ufb02ips for assessing the impact of soft errors in fault injection experiments. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether multiple-bit errors could cause a higher percentage of silent data corruptions (SDCs) compared to single-bit errors. Based on 2700 fault injection campaigns with 15 benchmark programs, featuring a total of 27 million experiments, our results show that single-bit errors in most cases yields a higher percentage of SDCs compared to multiple-bit errors. However, in 8% of the campaigns we observed a higher percentage of SDCs for multiple-bit errors. For most of these campaigns, the highest percentage of SDCs was obtained by \ufb02ipping at most 3 bits. Moreover, we propose three ways of pruning the error space based on the results.",

Unfortunately, for many general-purpose applications, available hardware resources of a GPGPU are not ef\ufb01ciently utilized, leading to lost opportunity in improving performance.

      "title": "PAVER: Locality Graph-Based Thread Block Scheduling for GPUs",
      "abstractNote": "The massive parallelism present in GPUs comes at the cost of reduced L1 and L2 cache sizes per thread, leading to serious cache contention problems such as thrashing. Hence, the data access locality of an application should be considered during thread scheduling to improve execution time and energy consumption. Recent works have tried to use the locality behavior of regular and structured applications in thread scheduling, but the difficult case of irregular and unstructured parallel applications remains to be explored.\n            \n              We present\n              PAVER\n              , a\n              P\n              riority-\n              A\n              ware\n              V\n              ertex schedul\n              ER\n              , which takes a graph-theoretic approach toward thread scheduling. We analyze the cache locality behavior among\n              thread blocks\n              (\n              TBs\n              ) through a just-in-time compilation, and represent the problem using a graph representing the TBs and the locality among them. This graph is then partitioned to TB groups that display maximum data sharing, which are then assigned to the same streaming multiprocessor by the locality-aware TB scheduler. Through exhaustive simulation in Fermi, Pascal, and Volta architectures using a number of scheduling techniques, we show that PAVER reduces L2 accesses by 43.3%, 48.5%, and 40.21% and increases the average performance benefit by 29%, 49.1%, and 41.2% for the benchmarks with high inter-TB locality.",

      "abstractNote": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are popular in artificial intelligence areas due to their high accuracy. Meanwhile, as manufacturing process technology scales, the probability of soft errors occurrence in computer systems increases, which causes reliability challenges for CNNs. For emerging safety and reliability critical CNN applications, such as autonomous vehicles, soft errors may cause catastrophic consequences. Thus it is important to analyze the vulnerability characteristics of CNNs. A common approach to analyze CNNs\u2019 reliability is fault injection, which requires a lot of computation resources and is time consuming. Thus a more efficient method is desired. In this work, we propose an analytical model named SERN to analyze the soft error reliability of CNNs, which requires only a small number of parameters in CNN models. Validation on several common CNN models shows SERN can efficiently and accurately perform soft error reliability analysis for CNNs. We also observe that the reliability of CNNs depend on data types, values, the sign of data and types of layers. Take advantage of these observations, we propose to protect vulnerable bits through ECC and protect error-prone layers through redundancy.",

      "abstractNote": "Power estimation is the basis of many hardware optimization strategies. However, it is still challenging to offer accurate power estimation at an early stage such as highlevel synthesis (HLS). In this paper, we propose PowerGear, a graph-learning-assisted power estimation approach for FPGA HLS, which features high accuracy, ef\ufb01ciency and transferability. PowerGear comprises two main components: a graph construction \ufb02ow and a customized graph neural network (GNN) model. Speci\ufb01cally, in the graph construction \ufb02ow, we introduce buffer insertion, datapath merging, graph trimming and feature annotation techniques to transform HLS designs into graph-structured data, which encode both intra-operation micro-architectures and inter-operation interconnects annotated with switching activities. Furthermore, we propose a novel power-aware heterogeneous edge-centric GNN model which effectively learns heterogeneous edge semantics and structural properties of the constructed graphs via edge-centric neighborhood aggregation, and \ufb01ts the formulation of dynamic power. Compared with on-board measurement, PowerGear estimates total and dynamic power for new HLS designs with errors of 3.60% and 8.81%, respectively, which outperforms the prior arts in research and the commercial product Vivado. In addition, PowerGear demonstrates a speedup of 4\u00d7 over Vivado power estimator. Finally, we present a case study in which PowerGear is exploited to facilitate design space exploration for FPGA HLS, leading to a performance gain of up to 11.2%, compared with methods using state-of-the-art predictive models.",

      "title": "Practical Resilience Analysis of GPGPU Applications in the Presence of Single- and Multi-Bit Faults",
      "abstractNote": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have rapidly evolved to enable energy-ef\ufb01cient data-parallel computing for a broad range of scienti\ufb01c areas. While GPUs achieve exascale performance at a stringent power budget, they are also susceptible to soft errors, often caused by high-energy particle strikes, that can signi\ufb01cantly affect the application output quality. Understanding the resilience of general purpose GPU (GPGPU) applications is especially challenging because unlike CPU applications, which are mostly single-threaded, GPGPU applications can contain hundreds to thousands of threads, resulting in a tremendously large fault site space in the order of billions, even for some simple applications and even when considering the occurrence of just a single-bit fault. We present a systematic way to progressively prune the fault site space aiming to dramatically reduce the number of fault injections such that assessment for GPGPU application error resilience becomes practical. The key insight behind our proposed methodology stems from the fact that while GPGPU applications spawn a lot of threads, many of them execute the same set of instructions. Therefore, several fault sites are redundant and can be pruned by careful analysis. We identify important features across a set of 10 applications (16 kernels) from Rodinia and Polybench suites and conclude that threads can be primarily classi\ufb01ed based on the number of the dynamic instructions they execute. We therefore achieve signi\ufb01cant fault site reduction by analyzing only a small subset of threads that are representative of the dynamic instruction behavior (and therefore error resilience behavior) of the GPGPU applications. Further pruning is achieved by identifying the dynamic instruction commonalities (and differences) across code blocks within this representative set of threads, a subset of loop iterations within the representative threads, and a subset of destination register bit positions. The above steps result in a tremendous reduction of fault sites by up to seven orders of magnitude. Yet, this reduced fault site space accurately captures the error resilience pro\ufb01le of GPGPU applications. We show the effectiveness of the proposed progressive pruning technique for a single-bit model and illustrate its application to even more challenging cases with three distinct multi-bit fault models.",

      "abstractNote": "With the widespread use of the multicore systems having smaller transistor sizes, soft errors become an important issue for parallel program execution. Fault injection is a prevalent method to quantify the soft error rates of the applications. However, it is very time consuming to perform detailed fault injection experiments. Therefore, prediction-based techniques have been proposed to evaluate the soft error vulnerability in a faster way. In this work, we present a soft error vulnerability prediction approach for parallel applications using machine learning algorithms. We de\ufb01ne a set of features including thread communication, data sharing, parallel programming, and performance characteristics; and train our models based on three ML algorithms. This study uses the parallel programming features, as well as the combination of all features for the \ufb01rst time in vulnerability prediction of parallel programs. We propose two models for the soft error vulnerability prediction: (1) A regression model with rigorous feature selection analysis that estimates correct execution rates, (2) A novel classi\ufb01cation model that predicts the vulnerability level of the target programs. We get maximum prediction accuracy rate of 73.2% for the regression-based model, and achieve 89% F-score for our classi\ufb01cation model.",

      "title": "Quantitatively Modeling Application Resilience with the Data Vulnerability Factor",
      "abstractNote": "Recent strategies to improve the observable resilience of applications require the ability to classify vulnerabilities of individual components (e.g., data structures, instructions) of an application, and then, selectively apply protection mechanisms to its critical components. To facilitate this vulnerability classi\ufb01cation, it is important to have accurate, quantitative techniques that can be applied uniformly and automatically across real-world applications. Traditional methods cannot effectively quantify vulnerability, because they lack a holistic view to examine system resilience, and come with prohibitive evaluation costs. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven, practical methodology to analyze these application vulnerabilities using a novel resilience metric: the data vulnerability factor (DVF). DVF integrates knowledge from both the application and target hardware into the calculation. To calculate DVF, we extend a performance modeling language to provide a structured, fast modeling solution. We evaluate our methodology on six representative computational kernels; we demonstrate the signi\ufb01cance of DVF by quantifying the impact of algorithm optimization on vulnerability, and by quantifying the effectiveness of speci\ufb01c hardware protection mechanisms.",

      "abstractNote": "As GPUs become more pervasive in both scalable high-performance computing systems and safety-critical embedded systems, evaluating and analyzing their resilience to soft errors caused by high-energy particle strikes will grow increasingly important. GPU designers must develop tools and techniques to understand the effect of these soft errors on applications. This paper presents an error injection-based methodology and tool called SASSIFI to study the soft error resilience of massively parallel applications running on stateof-the-art NVIDIA GPUs. Our approach uses a low-level assembly-language instrumentation tool called SASSI to pro\ufb01le and inject errors. SASSI provides ef\ufb01ciency by allowing instrumentation code to execute entirely on the GPU and provides the ability to inject into different architecture-visible state. For example, SASSIFI can inject errors in general-purpose registers, GPU memory, condition code registers, and predicate registers. SASSIFI can also inject errors into addresses and register indices. In this paper, we describe the SASSIFI tool, its capabilities, and present experiments to illustrate some of the analyses SASSIFI can be used to perform.",

      "title": "SDCTune: a model for predicting the SDC proneness of an application for configurable protection",
      "abstractNote": "Silent Data Corruption (SDC) is a serious reliability issue in many domains, including embedded systems. However, current protection techniques are brittle, and do not allow programmers to trade off performance for SDC coverage. Further, many of them require tens of thousands of fault injection experiments, which are highly time-intensive. In this paper, we propose an empirical model to predict the SDC proneness of a program\u2019s data called SDCTune. SDCTune is based on static and dynamic features of the program alone, and does not require fault injections to be performed. We then develop an algorithm using SDCTune to selectively protect the most SDC-prone data in the program subject to a given performance overhead bound. Our results show that our technique is highly accurate at predicting the relative SDC rate of an application, and outperforms full duplication by a factor of 0.83 to 1.87x in ef\ufb01ciency of detection (i.e., ratio of SDC coverage provided to performance overhead).",

      "abstractNote": "To prevent rejecting requests, cloud platforms typically provision for their peak demand. Thus, a platform\u2019s idle capacity can be signi\ufb01cant, as demand varies widely over multiple time scales, e.g., daily and seasonally. To reduce waste, platforms have begun to offer this idle capacity in the form of transient servers, which they may unilaterally revoke, for much lower prices\u2014\u223c50-90% less\u2014than on-demand servers, which they cannot revoke. However, transient servers\u2019 revocation characteristics\u2014their volatility and predictability\u2014in\ufb02uence their performance, since they affect the overhead of faulttolerance mechanisms applications use to handle revocations. Unfortunately, current cloud platforms offer no guarantees on revocation characteristics, which makes it dif\ufb01cult for users to optimally con\ufb01gure (and correctly value) transient servers. To address the problem, we propose the abstraction of a transient guarantee, which offers probabilistic assurances on revocation characteristics. Transient guarantees have numerous bene\ufb01ts: they increase the performance of transient servers, enable users to optimally use and correctly value them, and permit platforms to control their freedom to revoke them. We present policies for partitioning a variable amount of idle capacity into classes with different transient guarantees to maximize performance and value. We then implement and evaluate these policies on job traces from a production Google cluster. We show that our approach can increase the aggregate revenue from idle server capacity by up to \u223c6.5\u00d7 compared to existing approaches.",

      "abstractNote": "The security problems of smart contracts have drawn extensive attention due to the enormous financial losses caused by vulnerabilities. Existing methods on smart contract vulnerability detection heavily rely on fixed expert rules, leading to low detection accuracy. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks (GNNs) for smart contract vulnerability detection. Particularly, we construct a contract graph to represent both syntactic and semantic structures of a smart contract function. To highlight the major nodes, we design an elimination phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose a degree-free graph convolutional neural network (DR-GCN) and a novel temporal message propagation network (TMP) to learn from the normalized graphs for vulnerability detection. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting three different types of vulnerabilities.",

      "abstractNote": "Traditional fault detection/tolerance techniques exploit multiple instances of the nominal processing and then perform a bit-wise comparison of the outputs to detect the occurrence of faults. In speci\ufb01c application scenarios, e.g., image/signal processing, the elaboration has an inherent degree of fault tolerance because it is possible to use the output even in the presence of slight alterations. In these contexts, the classical bit-wise comparison may be inef\ufb01cient. Indeed, it may lead to conservatively discard outputs that have been only slightly altered by the fault and that could still be usefully exploited. In this paper, we propose a smart checking scheme based on Convolutional Neural Networks that rather than distinguishing between faulty and not faulty images, discriminates between usable and not usable images according to the ability of the end user to correctly process the output. The experimental evaluation shows that this solution enables an execution time saving of about 6.35% with a 99.42% accuracy, on average.",

      "abstractNote": "The trend of rapid technology scaling is expected to make the hardware of high-performance computing (HPC) systems more susceptible to computational errors due to random bit \ufb02ips. Some bit \ufb02ips may cause a program to crash or have a minimal effect on the output, but others may lead to silent data corruption (SDC), i.e., undetected yet signi\ufb01cant output errors. Classical fault injection analysis methods employ uniform sampling of random bit \ufb02ips during program execution to derive a statistical resiliency pro\ufb01le. However, summarizing such fault injection result with suf\ufb01cient detail is dif\ufb01cult, and understanding the behavior of the fault-corrupted program is still a challenge. In this article, we introduce SpotSDC, a visualization system to facilitate the analysis of a program\u2019s resilience to SDC. SpotSDC provides multiple perspectives at various levels of detail of the impact on the output relative to where in the source code the \ufb02ipped bit occurs, which bit is \ufb02ipped, and when during the execution it happens. SpotSDC also enables users to study the code protection and provide new insights to understand the behavior of a fault-injected program. Based on lessons learned, we demonstrate how what we found can improve the fault injection campaign method.",

      "title": "SUGAR: Speeding Up GPGPU Application Resilience Estimation with Input Sizing",
      "abstractNote": "As Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are becoming a de facto solution for accelerating a wide range of applications, their reliable operation is becoming increasingly important. One of the major challenges in the domain of GPU reliability is to accurately measure GPGPU application error resilience. This challenge stems from the fact that a typical GPGPU application spawns a huge number of threads and then utilizes a large amount of potentially unreliable compute and memory resources available on the GPUs. As the number of possible fault locations can be in the billions, evaluating every fault and examining its effect on theapplication error resilience is impractical. Application resilience is evaluated via extensive fault injection campaigns based on sampling of an extensive fault site space. Typically, the larger the input of the GPGPU application, the longer the experimental campaign. In this work, we devise a methodology, SUGAR (Speeding Up GPGPU Application Resilience Estimation with input sizing), that dramatically speeds up the evaluation of GPGPU application error resilience by judicious input sizing. We show how analyzing a small fraction of the input is sufficient to estimate the application resilience with high accuracy and dramatically reduce the duration of experimentation. Key of our estimation methodology is the discovery of repeating patterns as a function of the input size. Using the well-established fact that error resilience in GPGPU applications is mostly determined by the dynamic instruction count at the thread level, we identify the patterns that allow us to accurately predict application error resilience for arbitrarily large inputs. For the cases that we examine in this paper, this new resilience estimation mechanism provides significant speedups (up to 1336 times) and 97.0 on the average, while keeping estimation errors to less than 1%.",

      "abstractNote": "Graph representation learning has attracted increasing research attention. However, most existing studies fuse all structural features and node attributes to provide an overarching view of graphs, neglecting finer substructures\u2019 semantics, and suffering from interpretation enigmas. This paper presents a novel hierarchical subgraphlevel selection and embedding-based graph neural network for graph classification, namely SUGAR, to learn more discriminative subgraph representations and respond in an explanatory way. SUGAR reconstructs a sketched graph by extracting striking subgraphs as the representative part of the original graph to reveal subgraph-level patterns. To adaptively select striking subgraphs without prior knowledge, we develop a reinforcement pooling mechanism, which improves the generalization ability of the model. To differentiate subgraph representations among graphs, we present a self-supervised mutual information mechanism to encourage subgraph embedding to be mindful of the global graph structural properties by maximizing their mutual information. Extensive experiments on six typical bioinformatics datasets demonstrate a significant and consistent improvement in model quality with competitive performance and interpretability.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper focuses on spectral graph convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), where \ufb01lters are de\ufb01ned as elementwise multiplication in the frequency domain of a graph. In machine learning settings where the data set consists of signals de\ufb01ned on many di\ufb00erent graphs, the trained ConvNet should generalize to signals on graphs unseen in the training set. It is thus important to transfer ConvNets between graphs. Transferability, which is a certain type of generalization capability, can be loosely de\ufb01ned as follows: if two graphs describe the same phenomenon, then a single \ufb01lter or ConvNet should have similar repercussions on both graphs. This paper aims at debunking the common misconception that spectral \ufb01lters are not transferable. We show that if two graphs discretize the same \u201ccontinuous\u201d space, then a spectral \ufb01lter or ConvNet has approximately the same repercussion on both graphs. Our analysis is more permissive than the standard analysis. Transferability is typically described as the robustness of the \ufb01lter to small graph perturbations and re-indexing of the vertices. Our analysis accounts also for large graph perturbations. We prove transferability between graphs that can have completely di\ufb00erent dimensions and topologies, only requiring that both graphs discretize the same underlying space in some generic sense.",

      "abstractNote": "We aim to better understand attention over nodes in graph neural networks (GNNs) and identify factors in\ufb02uencing its effectiveness. We particularly focus on the ability of attention GNNs to generalize to larger, more complex or noisy graphs. Motivated by insights from the work on Graph Isomorphism Networks, we design simple graph reasoning tasks that allow us to study attention in a controlled environment. We \ufb01nd that under typical conditions the effect of attention is negligible or even harmful, but under certain conditions it provides an exceptional gain in performance of more than 60% in some of our classi\ufb01cation tasks. Satisfying these conditions in practice is challenging and often requires optimal initialization or supervised training of attention. We propose an alternative recipe and train attention in a weakly-supervised fashion that approaches the performance of supervised models, and, compared to unsupervised models, improves results on several synthetic as well as real datasets.

      "abstractNote": "Architecture designers tend to integrate both CPUs and GPUs on the same chip to deliver energy-ef\ufb01cient designs. It is still an open problem to effectively leverage the advantages of both CPUs and GPUs on integrated architectures. In this work, we port 42 programs in Rodinia, Parboil, and Polybench benchmark suites and analyze the co-running behaviors of these programs on both AMD and Intel integrated architectures. We \ufb01nd that co-running performance is not always better than running the program only with CPUs or GPUs. Among these programs, only eight programs can bene\ufb01t from the co-running, while 24 programs only using GPUs and seven programs only using CPUs achieve the best performance. The remaining three programs show little performance preference for different devices. Through extensive workload characterization analysis, we \ufb01nd that architecture differences between CPUs and GPUs and limited shared memory bandwidth are two main factors affecting current co-running performance. Since not all the programs can bene\ufb01t from integrated architectures, we build an automatic decision-tree-based model to help application developers predict the co-running performance for a given CPU-only or GPU-only program. Results show that our model correctly predicts 14 programs out of 15 for evaluated programs. For a co-run friendly program, we further propose a pro\ufb01ling-based method to predict the optimal workload partition ratio between CPUs and GPUs. Results show that our model can achieve 87.7 percent of the optimal performance relative to the best partition. The co-running programs acquired with our method outperform the original CPU-only and GPU-only programs by 34.5 and 20.9 percent respectively.",

      "abstractNote": "Deep learning neural networks (DNNs) have been successful in solving a wide range of machine learning problems. Specialized hardware accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the execution of DNN algorithms for high-performance and energy efficiency. Recently, they have been deployed in datacenters (potentially for business-critical or industrial applications) and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars. Soft errors caused by high-energy particles have been increasing in hardware systems, and these can lead to catastrophic failures in DNN systems. Traditional methods for building resilient systems, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), are agnostic of the DNN algorithm and the DNN accelerator\u2019s architecture. Hence, these traditional resilience approaches incur high overheads, which makes them challenging to deploy. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the resilience characteristics of DNN systems (i.e., DNN software running on specialized accelerators). We find that the error resilience of a DNN system depends on the data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers in the design. Based on our observations, we propose two efficient protection techniques for DNN systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Aggressive technology scaling trends have worsened the transient fault problem in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Some faults are benign, but others can lead to silent data corruption (SDC), which represents a serious problem; a fault introducing an error that is not readily detected nto an HPC simulation . Due to the insidious nature of SDCs, researchers have worked to understand their impact on applications. Previous studies have relied on expensive fault injection campaigns with uniform sampling to provide overall SDC rates, but this solution does not provide any feedback on the code regions without samples. In this research, we develop a method to systematically analyze all fault injection sites in an application with a low number of fault injection experiments. We use fault propagation data from a fault injection experiment to predict the resiliency of other untested fault sites and obtain an approximate fault tolerance threshold value for each site, which represents the largest error that can be introduced at the site without incurring incorrect simulation results. We define the collection of threshold values over all fault sites in the program as a fault tolerance boundary and propose a simple but efficient method to approximate the boundary. In our experiments, we show our method reduces the number of fault injection samples required to understand a program\u2019s resiliency by several orders of magnitude when compared with a traditional fault injection study.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction\u2019s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a uni\ufb01ed framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identi\ufb01cation of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class uni\ufb01es six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this uni\ufb01cation, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.",

      "abstractNote": "GPUs lack fundamental support for data-dependent parallelism and synchronization. While CUDA Dynamic Parallelism signals progress in this direction, many limitations and challenges still remain. This paper introduces Wireframe, a hardware-software solution that enables generalized support for data-dependent parallelism and synchronization. Wireframe enables applications to naturally express execution dependencies across different thread blocks through a dependency graph abstraction at run-time, which is sent to the GPU hardware at kernel launch. At run-time, the hardware enforces the dependencies speci\ufb01ed in the dependency graph through a dependencyaware thread block scheduler. Overall, Wireframe is able to improve total execution time up to 65.20% with an average of 45.07%.",
